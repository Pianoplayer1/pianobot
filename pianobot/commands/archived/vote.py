@everyone as decided somewhere above here, we will now vote on **every single member**'s rank, regardless of their current one! This was an idea to kind of clean up the rank distribution we have right now. In the above votes, you will find a member's ingame name, rank and inactivity time. Please take the time to look at each member and decide on their rank, even though it will take some time.
For more information about the general idea of this mega-vote, look at https://discord.com/channels/682671629213368351/727608200895135784/922212425263120465.

The reactions symbolize the following:
:baby:  - Citizen (Recruit)
{get(ctx.guild.emojis, name='sanglasis')}  - Legionnaire (Recruiter: able to access public bank)
:military_helmet:  - Legate (Captain: able to start wars)
:warning:  - Tribune (Strategist: able to do economy & access private bank)
:exclamation:  - Senate (Strategist)
:bangbang:  - Dux (Chief: able to manage the guild ingame, e.g. when it comes to rewards, allies, hq, banner...)

The exclamation marks aren't there without a reason, remember that everyone with three stars and above is able to manage the guild in some ways and to impact our relations to other guilds, especially those who get into the Senate.
For the votes on <@235781853179543553>, <@290191000813568001>, <@718558765988970616>, <@284500595920863233>, <@232178035841957899> and <@437305878257860608>, consider their Senate applications in #elections too.
Please refrain from memeing around on those votes, it's simply faster if you stay on topic and just vote.
